As I complete my final Rails project, I reflect upon how far I’ve come.  It took awhile to get here what with life sometimes getting in the way - I got sick, my kids got sick, my husband got sick.  Then my house sustained extensive water damage, putting us through what seems like a very long restoration period (it’s been about 3.5 months and we’re not done yet).  Basically anything that could have gone wrong, appeared to go wrong.  And that’s not adding basic duties and events of life in general. Okay, now that I’ve gotten that out of my system let’s talk about my final project. 

For my final project I decided to expand my final Sinatra project - creating a cars collection that could be saved to a database.  In the Rails-modified iteration a user is able to create a collection of cars and assign a parking space to each car.  I really wanted to see how a programmer could take an existing project and continue working on improving and changing it.  What better way to witness and experiment with technology than to have a ‘final’ first version and then create a version 2 to test new features?  

As I thought about how to approach this project, I thought about the pros and cons.  The pros include, but are not limited to:

1. Translating an application from one framework to another allows for a beginner such as myself to really see the similarities and understand the differences between these frameworks;
2. My familiarity with my final Sinatra project allowed me to think of other features I could add that would make my application more functional; and
3. Being a lazy programmer and tackling an already existing project can simplify the implementation of new features.  This is awesome!

On the other hand, the cons include, but are not limited to:

1. If not careful, I could run into problems and not have my code be DRY; and
2. Being a lazy programmer and tackling an already existing project can oversimplify the implementation of new features.  This can be a downer. 

Okay, I realize that #3 and #2 from the lists above are virtually identical, but hence the dilemma that programmers face on a daily basis.  We can think of similar pros and cons to almost everything programmers can put down in a text editor or the terminal.  It might work, but it might not.  There will be tons of trial and error with a modicum of success, but a whole lot of failure.  The good times could be great, but the bad times could really make you doubt whether this path was meant to be traveled by you.  

The end of the Rails section has me analyzing and assessing my own progress.  I continue to learn and grow as a programmer, and will continue exposing myself to all kinds of technical material.  I started learning to code almost exactly a year ago, and while I know I’ve learned a lot, I still have so much more to cover.  I cannot guarantee that I am or will become a good programmer, but I will continue to enjoy the learning process and see where it takes me.  Programming is a journey, full of twists and turns, peaks and valleys.  

In the meantime, I will revel in my organized chaos of life and code.  Thank goodness I am done with my Rails project.  Now, on to the next one.
