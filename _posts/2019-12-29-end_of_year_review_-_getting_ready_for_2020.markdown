I can’t believe how fast 2019 came and went.  I can only hope that 2020 slows down just a bit for me to catch my breath.  I know it’s cliche to comment about how fast time is passing us by, but this cliche rings true every time I look at my kids and see how much they’ve grown, or when I can’t remember whether something happened in the current year or the year before.  I wanted to write a post-mortem of the year that was 2019.  Everyone else does it, so why not?  I know this is supposed to be a technical blog, but even in tech a little thing called life sometimes gets in the way.  When it comes to our own individual journeys, it’s always good to take stock of the good, the bad and the ugly, and look ahead to what’s to come.  Writing his will help me see how this year helped shape me for what’s to come in 2020.  Here goes nothing…


# Starting Out on the Wrong Foot

2019 started with me being sick.  In fact, I spent most of December 2018 combating different versions of the flu that wouldn’t let up.  This was not a good sign.  I’m not superstitious (my birthday falls on Friday the 13th every few years and I would argue that luck is always on my side ;-)), but I hate the idea of starting out the year being physically or mentally unwell.  I fought to get healthy again, but it felt like an uphill battle.  I had to take time off from coding and to get better.  In the moment it felt terrible and it felt like a major set back, but in retrospect, it was the best thing I did.  I needed to regroup and make sure that I came back stronger.  Once I was physically strong, I got my focus back and I was back in my stride.

# It’s My Graduation...Hooray!!!

In August, I passed my final project for Flatiron School’s online software engineer program and officially graduated in September!!!  For me, it was a big deal.  When I started back in July 2017 I thought I would get through the full course in 6 months.  I don’t know what I was thinking.  But that’s in the past.  I did it, and that’s what matters!

# The Art of Networking

I started my official job search.  I haven’t been in the job hunt since 2002 when I got my first job right out of college and stayed with the same company for 15 years.  Between generating a new resume, practicing how to interview, learning how to do technical interviews and meeting tons of people, I can’t remember the last time I felt so exposed.  In the process of looking for a new job in an industry I was completely unfamiliar with just a couple of years, I’ve been completely vulnerable.  The world has changed since the last time I looked for a new job.  The way we present ourselves nowadays is very different.  There was no Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or LinkedIn 17+ years ago.  We didn’t have to think about our social media presence back then.  Nowadays, while there is still value in making face to face connections, we also have the added layer of connecting to these people and their extended connections through all types of platforms.  It’s a lot of work, but I’ve learned a lot about myself through the process.  However, the more I uncover, the more I have to find.  2020 is going to be very interesting as I continue exploring the different layers that make me who I am as a person and who I hope to be as a professional.

# Blogging Just Because

This year I wrote more than since my college days.  It’s taken me a while to warm up to the idea of writing technical blogs as a way to learn and focus on topics that were once unfamiliar.  I never thought I would say this, but I want to keep writing.  It’s become a good release of thoughts and ideas ruminating in my head.  In 2020, I will continue challenging my own notion of myself as a writer and will continue to learn through my writing.

#  Welcome 2020 With Open Arms

In 2020 I want to do more of all of the above and then some.  I want to do away with my fears and anxieties, with a deeper focus and understanding of doing things to help me grow.  I want to work as a software developer and want to do work that matters.  I want to continue making connections and meeting cool and interesting people doing amazing things in tech.  I want to give more to my family while also focusing on myself.  I want to be healthy and welcome my 40th year of life with a big bang.  All things are possible as long as I stay committed to the process and to my journey.  Through the ups and downs that 2019 brought, I embraced all of it.  I survived.  My family thrived.  My coding skills grew.  2019 taught me that I am still capable of rolling with the punches.  I didn’t make it this far for nothing. I am ready for 2020 and the challenges that lie ahead.  Bring it on 2020, I am ready!
