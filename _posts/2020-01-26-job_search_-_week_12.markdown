## *Keep Trying, Keep Trying, Don’t Give Up, Never Give Up* - Yo Gabba Gabba

It’s been 8 weeks since my last job search blog.  It’s so nice to vent in this way, but I also don’t want to bog down this blog with the negative thoughts and feelings that could sometimes take over.  Anyway, December was a slow time for diving head first into a job search.  The month started out strong with a series of major interviews.  I was starting to feel really good about things, and I felt like I was firing on all cylinders.  Then December 15th hit, and it’s as if everything shut down.  People seemed to be in holiday mode.  I can’t say I blame anyone for wanting to get into the holiday spirit.  It's just in our nature. 

Now we’re in the new year and everything has slowly been ramping up.  I have updated my resume, sent out more applications than ever before, and become bolder.  More opportunities have come my way, and I’ve been keeping busy working on projects and building relationships through [Moms Can Code School](https://www.momscan.co/), while also tapping into my network near and far.  This is not to say it’s gotten any easier, but I think I’ve gotten better.

Today I introduced my 8-year-old son to the old Looney Toons Road Runner cartoons.  I had grown up watching them and had forgotten how funny they were.  It was good to enjoy something that didn’t require any real thinking or the laser focus you need to have when watching a new algorithms tutorial.

Anyway, today they provided some much needed levity after a couple of weeks of busy work and crazy ups and downs. However, even as I sat watching this old, silly cartoon and wanting to clear my head, I couldn’t help but relate to that classic chase.  I am currently feeling like Wile E. Coyote, but I really want to be the Road Runner.

The fact of the matter is that I have a deep understanding of the good and the bad of the process of searching for a job.  But I am determined to focus on the good.  So far I have connected with some amazing people, and I have pushed myself to new limits to ensure that I continue to grow out of this experience.  The most important thing that I have done in recent weeks is keep learning and building upon my skills.

And that, my friends, is the key.  You have to continue improving upon your process and your skills.  I know this is not new information.  I could easily spend all day writing about all the negative aspects of the job search, but it's not helpful to me and does not allow for growth and learning.  I’ve [previously expressed](http://yescano.com/job_search_-_week_4_learning_to_not_let_rejection_get_me_down) how exhausting it all is and how vulnerable we become through this process, but I want to focus on all that I’ve gained instead of what I don’t have.  To bring it full circle you have to keep trying, keep pushing, and don’t give up.  The lows have the potential to really bring us down, but I’m in this to enjoy the fruits of my labor.


***Update*** - Today has been an overall rough day.  As everyone else I've been following the news of the death of Kobe Bryant and the 8 other passengers, including his 13-year-old daughter, in a helicopter crash.  I am devastated.  Writing this blog in the midst of the overwhelming sadness I felt helped to put things in perspective.  Life is short.  Love what you do and do what you love.  Kobe was a talented individual, but he was a true example of hard work, perseverance, determination and drive.  I hope his family finds comfort in each other and in their community.  May he and all of those lost today rest in peace.
